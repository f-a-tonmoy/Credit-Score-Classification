## 📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline for classifying credit scores using the [Credit Score Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification). It includes:
- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Feature engineering.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Visualizations for key insights.

## 📂 Dataset Details

**Source**: [Kaggle - Credit Score Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification)  
**Description**: The dataset provides customer-level information to predict credit scores.  

Key features:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Income**: Monthly income.
- **Loan Amount**: Loan applied or sanctioned.
- **Credit Score**: Target variable (e.g., Good, Average, Poor).

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and distributions.
- Feature engineering to enhance predictive power.
- Comparison of machine learning algorithms like Naive Byes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Hyperparameter Tuning.
- Comparative Analysis
